Building and Running
====================

Assumptions 
-----------

This application uses Java 8, and assumes it is available on the computer running it.
The instructions below for building the application assume that Maven is available.
 

Building the application with Maven
-----------------------------------

Run the maven install phase from the root of the application:

   > mvn package

This will create a slcsp_finder.jar in ./target/


Running the application
-----------------------

To run the application, execute the slcsp_finder jar with a single parameter, as follows:

   > java  -jar  target/slcsp_finder.jar  <the-single-parameter>

The value of this single parameter is the location (relative or absolute) of the 3 input files. 

For example, if the input files were in the '/data" beneath the directory you're running the application in, 
run the application as follows: 

   > java -jar target/slcsp_finder.jar ./data 

The results will overwrite the original values in the slcsp.csv file in that same directory.
